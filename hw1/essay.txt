The Future of AI: Biologically Inspired Intelligence
Along with the development of artificial intelligence, I think one of the most compelling next major advances will be the intersection of machine intelligence and biological intelligence in the brain neuroscience. To create truly intelligent machines requires understanding how the human brain works. This approach would shift AI from its current mathematical and algorithmic foundations toward an understanding rooted in how the human brain functions. As technologies in brain science and cognitive research develop alongside AI, we are witnessing the potential for the cross-integration of human and machine intelligence.
Brain neuron technology is leading to major changes in people's lives that will ultimately have a profound impact no less profound than that of the plow, the steam engine, electricity, or aerospace. In this epochal change, the goal that the new tools that form new technologies can precisely control is the most powerful factor in people's lives - thinking.
The technologies that are rapidly developing today include biochips that can interpret life processes inside cells and brain imaging. A common result of these two innovations is a clear understanding of how the brain works - both at the internal molecular level and at the overall level of the brain. By studying neurons and synapses in the brain, researchers can design more efficient and intelligent artificial neural networks.
Brain neuroscience + artificial intelligence, will become a new composite discipline, will also accelerate the cross-penetration with other disciplines. Especially with the breakthrough of super-resolution optical imaging, ontogenetic regulation, transparent brain, somatic cell cloning and other technologies, the development of brain and cognitive science will be deeply combined, and artificial intelligence will enter the stage of biologically inspired intelligence. The scope of this field may be broader than artificial intelligence.
We can try to reconstruct the brain with engineering methods, use llm, ml, etc., and develop a computer system with human brain function, that is, learn from the research of neurobiology to make the computer have perception, perception, cognition, thinking and consciousness. It is a neural network of energy and information processing created by the seven billion people on this planet, interacting in many ways and at many levels, private or public, local or global, in relation to each other and to nature, enabling people to be open to change.
In healthcare, biologically inspired AI could revolutionize the way we diagnose and treat neurological disorders. By mimicking the brain's function, AI systems can predict diseases earlier, improve treatment plans, and even interact directly with the human brain to provide real-time solutions. As Chen and Yadollahpour note, the combination of AI and brain science marks the beginning of a new era in cognitive neuroscience, a trend they describe as an "AI wave" in the field of cognitive neuroscience.

In short, the convergence of brain science and artificial intelligence promises to usher in a new era of machine intelligence, one that is closely linked to human cognition. We are on the cusp of creating neurotechnologies that will redefine the achievements of artificial intelligence.
